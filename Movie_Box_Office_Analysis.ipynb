To accomplish this I performed an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data better and visualized the relationships between different variables. Based on my findings, I will provide actionable insights for the movie studio.\n",

    "- `production_budget` - budget spent on the production of listed movie titles\n",
    "- `year` - year of release\n",
    "- `runtime_minutes` - minutes of runtime for each movie title\n",
    "- `genres` - genres for each movie title listed\n",
    "- `average_rating` - average rating for all listed movie titles\n",
    "- `num_votes` - number of votes per movie title\n",
    "- `popularity` - recorded popularity of each movie title\n",
    "- `vote_average` - average vote count for each movie title\n",

    "1. **Box Office Mojo Data**:\n",
    "   - Removed non-numeric characters from `foreign_gross` and filled missing values with 0.\n",
    "   - Filled missing `studio` values with 'Unknown'.\n",
    "   - Dropped rows with missing `domestic_gross`.\n",
    "2. **IMDb Data**:\n",
    "   - Filled missing `runtime_minutes` with the median value.\n",
    "   - Replaced missing `genres` with 'Unknown'.\n",
    "   - Ensured all movies had a title by filling missing `original_title` with `primary_title`.\n",
    "3. **The Numbers Data**:\n",
    "   - Removed non-numeric characters from `production_budget`, `domestic_gross`, and `worldwide_gross`.\n",
    "4. **TMDb Data**:\n",
    "   - Dropped unnecessary index column.\n",
    "   - Converted `popularity`, `vote_average`, and `vote_count` to numeric types.\n",
    "   - Converted `release_date` to datetime type.\n",
    "5. **Column Selection and Renaming**:\n",
    "   - Kept relevant columns and renamed them for consistency.\n",
    "   - Replaced zero values in financial columns to avoid issues with log transformation.\n",
    "   - Applied log transformation to normalize skewed financial data.\n",

    "- High production budgets are generally associated with higher revenues.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Invest in High Production Budgets**: Given the strong correlation with worldwide gross, investing in higher production budgets could yield better financial returns.\n",
    "2. **Focus on Popular Genres**: Biography-Drama-History and Action-Adventure-Animation movies tend to receive higher ratings, indicating a potential area for strategic focus.\n",
